+ GitHub URL: https://github.com/ByunTaeyeon02/IndividualCS161.git
+ Milestones with deadlines:
    + M1: Setting up the coding environment
    + M2: Creating table for 5x5 tile game
    + M3:
    + M4:
    + M5:
+ Front-end and back-end technologies:
    + Front-end: Javascript, HTML, Svelte, Tailwind, Unity
    + Back-end: Flask, Python
+ Algorithms/AI schemes used in the core engine:
    + Generating Puzzle: for each tile in the 5x5, use a random number generator to determine of the square is black or white
    + Solver: start with the highest numbered "line" and flip in the possible tiles to black
        + Ex: a line with 4 would mean that the center 3 out of 5 tiles will need to be flip
+ Marketspace / Selling point: A 5x5 simple tile game with free hints
